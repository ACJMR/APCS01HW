Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
-One thing that amazed me is how BIG everything is. Especially Jupitar--scary yet magical.
-How can we tell the difference between light from stars in the Milky Way and light from other galaxies?
-Why am I focusing so much on college if I matter so little...
-Lift the curtain, the boundary of the known world, and explore beyond. This philosophy can be applied to other sciences, not just astromony. Some may ask if the pursuit of knowledge, if science, is worth our time, money, tax dollars. These people should watch this show, a VERY pusuasive argument for science is layed out. 
-I like how the entire show emphasized that our knowledge today will certainly be enhanced in the future. For example, Tyson said that the Big Bang is as far back as we can see, for now. 
-It is staggering to think about the randomness involved in our (human) history. Although the more I think about it, the chances increase because of the gazillions of planets, all of which have a chance (allbeit low) of containing life.

Response to
Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
-Human pattern regonition a double edged sword: yes, it is a gift that has advanced our race and science, but we oftentimes see patterns that arent really there.
-We know names of serial killers, but not Jan Oort. How much does society really value science?
-prisoners of earth, limits our knowledge
-In 18th century England, coffeehouses were the centers of political/scientific thought, "labratory of democracy", if you will. Funny how coffee still plays a vital role in the lives of programmers and scientists today.  
-The importnace of curiosity cannot be understated. We are all born curious, according to Tyson, but lose our native curiousity when in school, when people teach us things instead of us figuring them out ourselves. How are kids expected to solve problems if in school they are SHOWN solutions, not FINDING them. Perhaps that's what Mr. Brown is doing with this course and the QAF.
-Tyson makes a good point; in a sense we are still babies in the context of astronomy. Not just astronomy, all fields of science and everything. Is knowledge boundless? Is there a limit for perfection? Deep questions we must consider as we further progress into the technologically advanced 21st century.
